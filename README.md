# Parents-n-Parks

Parents-N-Parks is a social media web application that connects Parents with other parents in order to overcome the social isolation that parenthood may bring. It is hard making new friends when you become a parent, but parents-n-parks makes it easier. This application was developed in collaboration with some of my fellow students at Code Platoon. My teammates were Josh Richardson, Tressa Sharma, Anthony Lemke, and Ka Leung.
